Hello all and welcome to KOder!!

I'm very excited to kick off this journey with you all as we grow my new platform into something special. 
Until the app is live and hosted on a server, I will keep all of it here for you all to have access to.

Enjoy and please leave feedback so we can all learn and grow together

Thanks, Kel



How to run---
  I made this appp using django so it will take a few steps in order to run my web app properly.
  
  -You will need a terminal space to launch the app (gitbash works well)
  
  -In your IED copy my code in the same format i have it diplayed. (App will not run if folders are not layed out perfectly)
  
  -Run command: cd Documents/cs50/final_project/Final_Project/Final_Project/
  
  -After this run the command: python manage.py runserver
    This will launch a local server for you to enjoy the webapp
